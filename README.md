Type of Visualization: I created a bar chart using D3.js to visualize a simple dataset because it provides a clear and easy-to-understand comparison of values

Key D3.js Features Used:

Data binding with data()
SVG elements for creating the bars
Basic styling for visualization clarity


Challenges Encountered:

Integrating D3.js into a WebView was initially confusing, but I overcame this by following tutorials on using WebView in Android and ensuring the JavaScript was enabled in WebSettings. and tutor in CS lounge katie helped me solve the github problem where it was quiet challenging to push from andriod studio from older version
